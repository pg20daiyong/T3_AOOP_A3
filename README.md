Look at the "mTarget" pointer, it doesn't look quite right does it?
Use your new knowledge of handles and integrate in the handle framework
Implement handles in the game to resolve the crash
Submission
ZIP the ENTIRE PROJECT FOLDER, not just the .cpp or .h files
Only upload via Moodle, no email or external services submissions
Notes
Call your project anything you want - and submit a zip file with the following filename: "PG##YourName_Programming3_a3.zip"
Back up your work! Whenever you work on your project, copy the entire project folder to your flash drive AND the network drive. Copying it to Dropbox or Google Drive isnâ€™t a bad idea either
